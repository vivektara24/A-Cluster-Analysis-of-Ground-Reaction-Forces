# ML-FSP

This repository contains work perfomred from Spring 2024 to Fall 2025. The motivation of the work was to perform a cluster analysis of the forces 103 cross country athletes exerted on the ground while running at moderate pace to see if could be extracted from the dataset discrete biomechanical groupings.



The ground reaction forces (GRFs) of the subjects were recorded along three components of with respect to the ground: The Vertical (V), Anterior-Posterior (AP), and Mediolateral (ML) compnents.

It has been suggested that higher magnitude and rates of change of V impact forces transmitted to lower limbs during running may contriubte to running-related injuries [[1]](#ref1).
